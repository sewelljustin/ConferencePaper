\begin{abstract}
Due to the weaknesses of GPS signals indoors, a successful method of indoor
navigation is an important research topic. An indoor navigation application
running on a mobile device has numerous uses. The application could help new
students locate their classes or professors and it would especially benefit
disabled students by directing the student in the right direction while taking
the shortest route. This project presents a prototype of an indoor navigation
system using Bluetooth Low Energy beacon devices and mobile phones.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons provide a way of locating a mobile device
within doors. The mobile device has the capability to receive Bluetooth signals
sent out by the beacons. A mathematical model is then used to approximate the
distance between the mobile device and the beacon by using the transmitted
power level and received signal strength of the Bluetooth signal. A grid can
then be used to model a floor of a building with a beacon in each quadrant.
Methods of increasing the accuracy of the application include using a density
algorithm on a sample of received signals and also a probabilistic algorithm
that implements a variation of Bayes theorem.
